Wrappers for go to support multiple go releases, cross-compilation
and to improve usability.

go, godoc, gofmt
	Executes corresponding command with GOROOT and GOPATH set.
	If there is a version number specified as a first argument
	then corresponding version of the compiler is chosen instead
	of the default one.

	Each command expects compiler to reside in the upper level
	directory relative to it and with the version number in its
	name. For example:

	    bin/
	    go1.3.3/
	    go1.4.2/

	GOPATH is set to the current or closest upper level directory
	that contains src/. This way it is possible to work with the
	workspace from within its subdirectories. If no src/ directory
	is found, then GOPATH is set to current working directory.

	Example:

	    # runs foo.go under go1.3.3
	    go 1.3.3 run foo.go

	    # runs foo.go under default hardcoded version of go
	    go run foo.go

gox
	Executes go for every GOOS and GOARCH listed, adds both
	to -o option after the name of the program. Should be used
	with a build argument only.

	Example:

	    gox build -o foo foo.go
	    gox 1.4.2 build -o foo142 foo.go
