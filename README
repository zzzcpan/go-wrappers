NAME
    go-wrappers - set of wrappers for go

DESCRIPTION
    Wrappers for go to support multiple Go release version,
    cross-compilation and to improve usability.

WRAPPERS
    go, godoc, gofmt
	Executes corresponding command with GOROOT and GOPATH set.
	If there is a version number specified as a first argument
	then corresponding version of the compiler is chosen instead
	of the default one.

	Each command expects compiler to reside in the upper level
	directory relative to it and with the version number in its
	name. For example:

	    bin/
	    go1.3.3/
	    go1.4.2/

	GOPATH is set to the current working or closest upper level
	directory that contains src/. If no src/ directory is found,
	then GOPATH is set to the current working directory. This
	makes it possible to use the same workspace from within its
	subdirectories.

	Example:

	    # runs foo.go under go1.3.3
	    go 1.3.3 run foo.go

	    # runs foo.go under default hardcoded version of go
	    go run foo.go

    gox
	Executes go for every GOOS and GOARCH listed, adds both
	to -o option after the name of the program. Should be used
	with a build argument only.

	Example:

	    gox build -o foo foo.go
	    gox 1.4.2 build -o foo142 foo.go
